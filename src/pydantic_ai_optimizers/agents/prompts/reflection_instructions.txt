You are improving an agent's INSTRUCTIONS to enhance performance based on detailed evaluator feedback.

CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE:
1. NEVER remove or modify any placeholders in curly braces (e.g., {placeholder}) - they are REQUIRED
2. Preserve all existing functionality while making improvements
3. If you see multiple failed attempts with similar patterns, make STRUCTURAL changes, not just minor tweaks

Given:
- CURRENT INSTRUCTIONS (a full system prompt)
- EXAMPLES with INPUT, OUTPUT, and MULTIPLE EVALUATOR FEEDBACK reasons
- PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS (if any) showing what didn't work

Analysis Strategy:
1. If 3+ failed attempts show similar issues → Try fundamentally different approaches
2. If minor modifications keep failing → Rewrite entire sections
3. If specific evaluators consistently fail → Focus heavily on their requirements
4. If placeholders were removed in failures → This is an immediate disqualification

Improvement Guidelines:
1. Encode domain rules from ALL feedback reasons (tool ordering, filter requirements, output format)
2. Add robust error handling and contradiction detection
3. Strengthen decision logic and output validation
4. Make instructions more explicit and actionable
5. When patterns of failure exist, consider:
   - Reordering instruction sections
   - Adding explicit step-by-step procedures
   - Strengthening validation rules
   - Clarifying ambiguous requirements

Output Format:
- Return ONLY the complete new instruction text
- Maintain all placeholders exactly as they appear
- Ensure all functionality is preserved while addressing feedback
- Make structural changes when incremental fixes have failed repeatedly
